A Graph Approach for Interactive Hand Tracking (GAHT) - Andrea Lacagnina (Ongoing publication)

Abstract

Hand tracking is one of the most challenging problem addressed in computer vision from several decades. The continuously increasing quality of optical and depth sensors, together with their reduced size, enables the investigation of this problem on mobile setups. This work investigates on a graph-based method for hand tracking which can be employed on mobile devices relying on an essential geometric model. Currently, the major part of the most recent methods providing robust hand tracking need high performance systems, GPU acceleration architectures and/or rely on large training data-sets. Furthermore they may require special markers properly placed on the hand surface and may not be interactive. This work presents an interactive approach which do not rely on any large training data-set, making it particularly suitable for mobile devices with relatively limited resources. The proposed method models a graph for each hand, which is then used for the analysis of the components of the detected areas with a coarse-to-fine approach. In conclusion, the presented method allows markerless, interactive hand-tracking for devices with a low amount of resources in terms of memory and computational capabilities.
